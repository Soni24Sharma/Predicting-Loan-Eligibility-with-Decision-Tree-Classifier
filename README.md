# Predicting-Loan-Eligibility-with-Decision-Tree-Classifier
Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting loan eligibility based on applicant data using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model will utilize historical loan application data, including applicant demographics, financial history, and loan characteristics, to determine the likelihood of loan approval.

Key Objectives:

Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the loan application dataset, handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and identifying relevant features.
Build and train a Decision Tree Classifier: Develop and train a machine learning model using the Decision Tree algorithm to predict loan approval.
Feature importance analysis: Analyze the decision tree model to identify the most important features influencing loan approval decisions.
Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Visualize the decision tree: Create a visual representation of the decision tree to understand the decision-making process.
Expected Outcomes:

A well-trained Decision Tree Classifier model capable of predicting loan eligibility with reasonable accuracy.
Insights into the key factors that lenders consider when making loan approval decisions.
A better understanding of the decision-making process for loan applications.
Potential Challenges:

Data imbalance: Loan approval datasets may be imbalanced, with a higher proportion of approved loans compared to rejected ones.
Handling categorical variables: Effectively encoding categorical variables into a format suitable for the decision tree algorithm.
Overfitting: The decision tree model may overfit to the training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment (optional): Flask, Streamlit
